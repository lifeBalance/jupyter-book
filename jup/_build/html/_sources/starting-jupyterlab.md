# Starting the Jupyter Lab Server

Once all the dependencies have been installed, we can start up the [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) server by running:
```
jupyter lab
```

```{warning}
Make sure that your **virtual environment** is enabled, before trying to start the server.
```

That would generate some output in your terminal with some instructions about how to access the lab. Make sure you copy a line that looks like this:
```
http://localhost:8888/lab?token=08880dcf4622e4170ef4cc0b25444e3a1847e4b0bb986a6f
```

Paste it in your browser's address bar, and boom, you should be good to go.
